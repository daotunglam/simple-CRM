# SimpleCrm

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.1.

## Note:

Because of object-oriented programming, every user is converted into a model.

## Experiences that are getted from this project:

### git reset --hard d01fbe83f8d189de4a757f46364860cb3bc2b0c5

Because firebase was installed with error (see the commit <a href="https://github.com/daotunglam/simple-crm/commit/52a5084dd0199b6365b758141f9d3d299f1a35b3">52a5084</a>), I had to delete all the firebase-relationships in my project, in order to config them again.

Thank God the old commit is on github. I found the command to clone it back into the local:

<code>git reset --hard d01fbe83f8d189de4a757f46364860cb3bc2b0c5</code>

### resolving the git merge

After reset the entire code like the old commit, <code>git push</code> return the requests 

<code>git pull</code> and merge.

In order to choose all current changes from local, I have to give this command:

<code>git checkout --ours .</code>

before git-push all again.

### In order to keep a single div in the middle of the display and responsive

I found the best set:

1. let thisdivable/card in a container <code>.container{ padding: 1rem }</code>
2. let this div in the middle of container with <code>margin: auto;</code>
3. set the width of this div to be responsive (width, min-width, max-width)

For more details in this project:

<code>
.user-detail-container {

    //the best set I found to make the single table/card reponsive ðŸ‘‡:
    
    padding: 1rem; //makes a small distance between the table/card and the browsers edge
    
    .user-detail {
    
        min-width: calc(
    
            280px - 2rem
    
        ); //keeps the card/table being not too small in the small devices. Change the size-value as your needs to keep the content inside card/table looking best.
    
        width: calc(100% - 2rem);
    
        max-width: 1024px; //optional. To keep the card/table not to be so big in the giant-devices.
    
        margin: auto; //keeps the card/table in the middle horizontally.
    
    }
    
    //the best set I found to make the single table/card reponsive ðŸ‘†

}
</code>
